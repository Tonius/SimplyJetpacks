----------------------------------
Version 1.3.0
(unreleased)
----------------------------------
- Added 3D armor models for the jetpacks. Many thanks to Cybercat and dand0 for providing a model. (There is a config option to switch back to the boring old flat jetpacks.)
- Added a configurable speed boost when sprinting while flying forward
- Adding or removing armor is now done using a crafting grid. This allows armored jetpacks to be auto-crafted. Note that removing armor will only properly return plating if done by a player.
- Removed armoring NEI handlers as they are no longer needed
- Emergency hover mode can be toggled by switching hover mode while sneaking
- Sneaking while flying slows down sideways flight to half speed
- Jetpacks and Flux Packs are now on by default upon creation
- Fixed armored jetpacks absorbing much more damage than intended. This was making players invincible when they were also wearing other pieces of armor
- Fixed engine/hover controls not working when bound to mouse buttons
- Updated CoFH Energy API, and actually include the whole package this time *cough*
- RIP, resource pack authors



----------------------------------
Version 1.2.0
2014-10-18
----------------------------------
- Added full EnderIO support! This includes EnderIO versions of the jetpacks, flux packs and components.
- Integration with TE or EIO can be disabled/enabled in the config
- Changed the structure of the config... again. Mainly the tuning portions of it, make sure to transfer over any edits you did to them if needed.
- HUD now hides if F3 debug mode is enabled
- Code refactors and cleanups
- Note: the item IDs of Creative Jetpack/Flux Packs, Tuberous Jetpacks and Armor Platings have changed. Shouldn't cause any problems, they will just disappear or change into missing textures which you can just delete.



----------------------------------
Version 1.1.4
2014-10-02
----------------------------------
- Removed potentially infinite loop when upgrading jetpacks
- Fixed Leadstone Jetpack recipe not taking power from used Leadstone Flux Capacitors

----------------------------------
Version 1.1.3
2014-09-25

----------------------------------
Version 1.1.2
2014-09-24
----------------------------------
- Fixed spamming isue in the client console



----------------------------------
Version 1.1.1
2014-09-14
----------------------------------
- Added the Mysterious Potato (creative-only). It can do the thing. The thing involves spawners.
- Mobs can use jetpacks again. Should be less crashy than last time.
- Enchantability can now be set per jetpack/flux pack
- Jetpack particles now respect the particles option in the video settings menu
- Split the config file so that the client-only options are kept separate
- Fly and descend keys can now be changed using the configs, to be something else than the vanilla jump and sneak keys.
- Fixed potential memory leak in single player
- Various code cleanups



----------------------------------
Version 1.1.0
2014-08-16
----------------------------------
- Added Flux Packs. These items are worn as chestplates and can charge held items and other worn armor.
- Added the Flux-Infused JetPlate. Only available when Redstone Arsenal is installed, this is the new final tier of jetpacks. It is basically the Flux-Infused Chestplate, the Resonant Jetpack and the Resonant Flux Pack in one.
- Hover mode no longer makes the jetpack use less power. Default tuning values have been adjusted to balance this out.
- Some rebalancing of the default tuning values. If you wish to use these, use the config GUI to reset the tuning values, or delete the config file.
- Added a NEI plugin to show the 'recipes' for armored jetpacks.
- Replaced the status chat messages with a new part in the HUD that displays the states of the jetpack engine, hover mode, etc. Chat messages can still be enabled in the config.
- Updated CoFH API

- Some tweaks to tooltips. Energy level is now always visible. Also added some more info to the rest of the tooltips.

- LOTS of changes in the format of the language files. It is likely that anything other than English will break. If you want to fix this, please open a pull request.
- Also a lot of changes to what the texture file names are called. Sorry, texture pack users!
